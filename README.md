# BookListWithGoogleAPI
A small command line application that allows users to submit a search query and get results from the Google Books API. Written in Python.

My process: I began with a simple search function, then limited the results to the first five matches. From there I added the functionality to add an item to the list, then tidied up the results so that the list was readable to the user.
