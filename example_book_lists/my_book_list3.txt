 Title: The Year of the Dogs
Author(s): Author not found.
Publisher: Chronicle Books
Description: As a National Geographic photographer, taking pictures of lions, tigers, and bears was a regular day's work for Vincent Musi, but in 2017 he gave himself a new challenge: dogs. Using the same lighting and photographic techniques he uses for his photography, Musi spent a year shooting portraits of dogs. From a farting bulldog to a Labrador that likes opera, he chronicled the character and personality of everyday dogs. The result was a wildly successful Instagram account. The Year of the Dogs features 75 dogs from this series of exquisite photos with close-ups, profiles, and full body shots along with a narrative about each dog. Presented in an elegant package that properly showcases the vitality of Musi's photos, The Year of the Dogs will be the go-to gift book for dog lovers of the holiday season.

 Title: Underwater Dogs
Author(s): ['Seth Casteel']
Publisher: Little, Brown
Description: The exuberant, exhilarating photographs of dogs underwater that have become a sensation From the water's surface, it's a simple exercise: a dog's leap, a splash, and then a wet head surfacing with a ball, triumphant. But beneath the water is a chaotic ballet of bared teeth and bubbles, paddling paws, fur and ears billowing in the currents. From leaping Lab to diving Dachshund, the water is where a dog's distinct personality shines through; some lounge in the current, paddling slowly, but others arch their bodies to cut through the water with the focus and determination of a shark. In more than eighty portraits, award-winning pet photographer and animal rights activist Seth Casteel captures new sides of our old friends with vibrant underwater photography that makes it impossible to look away. Each image bubbles with exuberance and life, a striking reminder that even in the most loveable and domesticated dog, there are more primal forces at work. In Underwater Dogs, Seth Casteel gives playful and energetic testament to the rough-and-tumble joy that our dogs bring into our lives.
